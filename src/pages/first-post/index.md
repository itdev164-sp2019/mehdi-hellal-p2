Caleb Harper talks about his “food computer”. He was motivated to create something that would make more people interested in farming because he found in his travels around the world that young people do not want to farm. He made a box where he could control the climate of the plants in it with a computer and can control many details, like the flavor of the plan, by changing the climate. In his presentation, he used a lot of photos of his project at MIT and used a lot of humor. He joked a lot about engineers being farmers and made the Facebook like emoji’s thumb green. He made jokes about how humbling teaching kids is, like when a kid did not believe his definition of humidity. The pacing was good, it was quick and he mixed in humor and photos audience was not bored. The “path” of the presentation, started out big, looking at climate and countries farming habits and went smaller, from a “food computer” in a room at MIT, to a box that can be used in classrooms and less expensive. I enjoyed the presentation, and I like the idea of growing plants in any climate. Many fruits, like dates and pomegranates, are delicious in some places, but not very good here because they have to be transported, and also they are grown in climates different from the fruit I eat in their origin. However, I do not think I will want to build this in my home, I will focus instead on my garden in my back yard in spring.
