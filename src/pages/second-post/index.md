With the huge growth of technology in the 21st century, the internet is spreading around the world and people depend more and more on the internet and electronic devices affecting their lives. One important subject that is included in this growth of technology is business, or more specifically, the relationship between companies and customers through the virtual world. This relationship is presented through social media.

Facebook and Twitter are two of the most famous social media platforms these days, so we are going to analyze how Starbucks and McDonald`s are using Facebook and twitter to increase their business.



Starbucks:



Starbucks is already located in most countries of the world, which is one reason why they have more than 36 million fans on Facebook and more than 11 million followers on Twitter. These numbers represent their audience which contain all kinds of people between the ages of 13 to 40.

Starbucks uses social media such as Facebook and Twitter to connect and be close to their customers by sharing ideas, thoughts, and listening to their experiences, suggestions and what they say about the brand.

Despite the significant difference in numbers of fans on both social media platforms, the strategy used is almost the same while on Facebook they connect with people in all countries using many languages to make sure that all information is collected. They show how are they making products, introduce their staff and their favorite products, they try to know the best product for their customers and try to create excitement about them. Some people say that Facebook is not as frequently updated as the Twitter account.

Even the number of followers on Twitter is much less than the number on Facebook, it is still more active and updated where the company tries to post about their product and get feedback from the audience. Also, Starbucks gives importance to the features and tools presented on Twitter to select, manage and analyze their publications and their customers’ messages and their sense of humor so it makes the brand stand out from other.
McDonald’s



With over 70 million fans on Facebook and 3 million followers on Twitter, McDonald’s is one of the biggest brands followed around the world but this brand seems to have recently given importance to social media. Also, McDonald’s has similar strategies both social media accounts.

According to The Wall Street Journal, in 2016 McDonald’s hired 200 new social media employees to better target millennials.

Paul Matson, who is the director of Social Engagement at McDonald’s, a position created in 2015, said that McDonald’s “seemed deaf and mute”.

McDonald’s is very interactive and creative with their fans when they use extra multimedia and designed data added to the traditional methods of interacting with costumers like videos, games, funny suggestions about the brand, and allowing them to vote for a product on Twitter.

Seasonal events are a crucial factor at play on social media to present products. For example, they have different campaigns targeted at students during the school year and during the summer break. They interact with fans as a person, not as a company which make their followers identify more strongly with the brand.





Social media provide companies the opportunity to better understand customers and build customer loyalty by personalizing their interactions. Since Facebook is more popular, Twitter users are more engaged, companies can target their audiences worldwide.
